"O14654","IRS4_HUMAN",NA,"FUNCTION: Acts as an interface between multiple growth factor receptors possessing tyrosine kinase activity, such as insulin receptor, IGF1R and FGFR1, and a complex network of intracellular signaling molecules containing SH2 domains. Involved in the IGF1R mitogenic signaling pathway. Promotes the AKT1 signaling pathway and BAD phosphorylation during insulin stimulation without activation of RPS6KB1 or the inhibition of apoptosis. Interaction with GRB2 enhances insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. May be involved in nonreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling in myoblasts. Plays a pivotal role in the proliferation/differentiation of hepatoblastoma cell through EPHB2 activation upon IGF1 stimulation. May play a role in the signal transduction in response to insulin and to a lesser extent in response to IL4 and GH on mitogenesis. Plays a role in growth, reproduction and glucose homeostasis. May act as negative regulators of the IGF1 signaling pathway by suppressing the function of IRS1 and IRS2. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10531310, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10594015, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12639902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17408801, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9553137}.","cytosol [GO:0005829]; plasma membrane [GO:0005886]; insulin receptor binding [GO:0005158]; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding [GO:0043548]; insulin receptor signaling pathway [GO:0008286]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]",1257

Acts as a negative regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis by mediating the retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby blocking the processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:12202038, PubMed:16399501, PubMed:26311497, PubMed:32322062). Binds oxysterol, including 25-hydroxycholesterol, regulating interaction with SCAP and retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32322062). In presence of oxysterol, interacts with SCAP, retaining the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing SCAP from escorting SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 to the Golgi (PubMed:15899885, PubMed:32322062). Sterol deprivation or phosphorylation by PCK1 reduce oxysterol-binding, disrupting the interaction between INSIG1 and SCAP, thereby promoting Golgi transport of the SCAP-SREBP complex, followed by processing and nuclear translocation of SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:26311497, PubMed:32322062). Also regulates cholesterol synthesis by regulating degradation of HMGCR: initiates the sterol-mediated ubiquitin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR via recruitment of the reductase to the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 and/or RNF139 (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767). Also regulates degradation of SOAT2/ACAT2 when the lipid levels are low: initiates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SOAT2/ACAT2 via recruitment of the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 (PubMed:28604676). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12202038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12535518, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15899885, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16168377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16399501, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16606821, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22143767, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26311497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28604676, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062}.",NA,889

"P05019","IGF1_HUMAN",NA,"FUNCTION: The insulin-like growth factors, isolated from plasma, are structurally and functionally related to insulin but have a much higher growth-promoting activity. May be a physiological regulator of [1-14C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) transport and glycogen synthesis in osteoblasts. Stimulates glucose transport in bone-derived osteoblastic (PyMS) cells and is effective at much lower concentrations than insulin, not only regarding glycogen and DNA synthesis but also with regard to enhancing glucose uptake. May play a role in synapse maturation (PubMed:21076856, PubMed:24132240). Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of IGF1 is required for sensory perception of smell in the olfactory bulb (By similarity). Acts as a ligand for IGF1R. Binds to the alpha subunit of IGF1R, leading to the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity which autophosphorylates tyrosine residues in the beta subunit thus initiating a cascade of down-stream signaling events leading to activation of the PI3K-AKT/PKB and the Ras-MAPK pathways. Binds to integrins ITGAV:ITGB3 and ITGA6:ITGB4. Its binding to integrins and subsequent ternary complex formation with integrins and IGFR1 are essential for IGF1 signaling. Induces the phosphorylation and activation of IGFR1, MAPK3/ERK1, MAPK1/ERK2 and AKT1 (PubMed:19578119, PubMed:22351760, PubMed:23243309, PubMed:23696648). As part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via promotion of STUB1/CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05017, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19578119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21076856, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22351760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23243309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23696648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24132240}.","alphav-beta3 integrin-IGF-1-IGF1R complex [GO:0035867]; exocytic vesicle [GO:0070382]; extracellular region [GO:0005576]; extracellular space [GO:0005615]; insulin-like growth factor binding protein complex [GO:0016942]; insulin-like growth factor ternary complex [GO:0042567]; platelet alpha granule lumen [GO:0031093]; growth factor activity [GO:0008083]; hormone activity [GO:0005179]; insulin receptor binding [GO:0005158]; insulin-like growth factor receptor binding [GO:0005159]; integrin binding [GO:0005178]; activation of protein kinase B activity [GO:0032148]; bone mineralization involved in bone maturation [GO:0035630]; cell activation [GO:0001775]; cell population proliferation [GO:0008283]; cell surface receptor signaling pathway via STAT [GO:0097696]; cellular response to amyloid-beta [GO:1904646]; epithelial to mesenchymal transition [GO:0001837]; glycolate metabolic process [GO:0009441]; insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0048009]; muscle hypertrophy [GO:0014896]; muscle organ development [GO:0007517]; myoblast differentiation [GO:0045445]; myoblast proliferation [GO:0051450]; myotube cell development [GO:0014904]; negative regulation of amyloid-beta formation [GO:1902430]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway [GO:2001237]; negative regulation of gene expression [GO:0010629]; negative regulation of interleukin-1 beta production [GO:0032691]; negative regulation of neuroinflammatory response [GO:0150079]; negative regulation of oocyte development [GO:0060283]; negative regulation of release of cytochrome c from mitochondria [GO:0090201]; negative regulation of smooth muscle cell apoptotic process [GO:0034392]; negative regulation of tumor necrosis factor production [GO:0032720]; negative regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell apoptotic process [GO:1905460]; positive regulation of activated T cell proliferation [GO:0042104]; positive regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade [GO:0070886]; positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy [GO:0010613]; positive regulation of cell growth involved in cardiac muscle cell development [GO:0061051]; positive regulation of cell migration [GO:0030335]; positive regulation of cell population proliferation [GO:0008284]; positive regulation of D-glucose import [GO:0046326]; positive regulation of DNA binding [GO:0043388]; positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription [GO:0045893]; positive regulation of epithelial cell proliferation [GO:0050679]; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade [GO:0070374]; positive regulation of fibroblast proliferation [GO:0048146]; positive regulation of gene expression [GO:0010628]; positive regulation of glycogen biosynthetic process [GO:0045725]; positive regulation of glycolytic process [GO:0045821]; positive regulation of glycoprotein biosynthetic process [GO:0010560]; positive regulation of insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway [GO:0043568]; positive regulation of MAPK cascade [GO:0043410]; positive regulation of mitotic nuclear division [GO:0045840]; positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation [GO:0045669]; positive regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation [GO:0050731]; positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transduction [GO:0051897]; positive regulation of protein secretion [GO:0050714]; positive regulation of Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0046579]; positive regulation of smooth muscle cell migration [GO:0014911]; positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:0048661]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; positive regulation of transcription regulatory region DNA binding [GO:2000679]; positive regulation of trophectodermal cell proliferation [GO:1904075]; positive regulation of vascular associated smooth muscle cell proliferation [GO:1904707]; protein stabilization [GO:0050821]; proteoglycan biosynthetic process [GO:0030166]; Ras protein signal transduction [GO:0007265]; regulation of gene expression [GO:0010468]; response to heat [GO:0009408]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; skeletal muscle satellite cell maintenance involved in skeletal muscle regeneration [GO:0014834]; skeletal system development [GO:0001501]; wound healing [GO:0042060]",195
